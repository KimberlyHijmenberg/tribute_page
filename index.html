    <p>These magnificent creatures come in all shapes and sizes and live in a number of different environments. They all belong to a group of <strong>reptiles</strong> called <strong>Testudines</strong>, which includes <strong>turles</strong>, <strong>tortoises</strong>, and <strong>terrapins</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From giant, slow-moving land-dwelling tortoises and snappy terrapins basking in their fresh-water lagoons, to the graceful strokes of a sea turtle gliding through our oceans - check out our ten totally awesome turtle facts, below!</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world - beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!</li>
        <li>These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago - woah!</li>
        <li>Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous <strong>shell</strong>. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators - some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!</li>
        <li>Just like your bones, a turtle's shell is actually part of its skeleton. It's made up of over <strong>50 bones</strong> which include the turtle's <strong>rib cage</strong> and <strong>spine</strong>.</li>
        <li>Contrary to popular belief, a turtle cannot come out of its shell. The turtle's shell grows with them, so it's impossible for them to grow too big for it!</li>
        <li>What a turtle eats depends on the environment it lives in. Land-dwelling turtles will munch on <strong>beetles</strong>, <strong>fruit</strong>, and <strong>grass</strong>, whereas sea dwellers will goblle everything from <strong>algae</strong> to <strong>squid</strong> and <strong>jellyfish</strong>.</li>
        <li>Some turtles are <strong>carnivores</strong> (meat eaters), others are <strong>herbivores</strong> (plant eaters) and some are <strong>omnivores</strong> (a mixture of the two!). Many baby turtles start life as carnivores but grow to eat more plants as they mature.</li>
        <li>Turtles are '<strong>amniotes</strong>' - they breathe air and lay their eggs on land, although many species live in or around water.</li>
        <li>These cold-blooded creatures have an incredibly long life span. The oldest ever recorded, named <strong>Tu"i Malila</strong>, of Tong Island, passed away at the grand old age of <strong>188</strong></li>
        <li>Sadly, many species of turtle are endangered! <strong>129</strong> of approximately 300 species of turtle and tortoise on Earth today are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the <strong>IUCN</strong>. Threats include loss of habitat, poaching and the illegal pet trade.</li>
